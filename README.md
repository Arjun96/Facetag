# FaceTag
FaceTag is an app created for NHacks 2016.
Recipient of the Most Promising Future Startup Award.

##What is it?
This is the networking app to make networking more fun and interactive for the users. 

###How To
1. Create an account and connect pictures of your face to the account so we know what you look like. Oh and connect your social media.
2. Choose an event you want to join or are already in (e.g. A Conference, hackathon, networking event, camp, etc.) 
3. Take a picture of the person you want to connect with. As long as they're in our system too and in this event, this will work.
4. We will connect that picture of their face with their account in our system and let you connect with whatever social media account they want you to connect with.
5. Oh and collect points based off of how many people you connect with! Our rewards-based system helps keep things moving and playful.
